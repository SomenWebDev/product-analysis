        Bookque is an online bookstore with a mission to financially support
        local, independent bookstores. We believe that bookstores are essential
        to a healthy culture. They’re where authors can connect with readers,
        where we discover new writers, where children get hooked on the thrill
        of reading that can last a lifetime. They’re also anchors for our
        downtowns and communities. As more and more people buy their books
        online, we wanted to create an easy, convenient way for you to get your
        books and support bookstores at the same time.
